## Accessing the API

We offer two types of API keys:

- **Production API Key**: Used for live, real-world applications with higher rate limits.
- **Sandbox API Key**: Used for development and testing purposes with lower rate limits and a 4-week expiration period.

To obtain either a Production or Sandbox API key, please contact us directly. We will assist you in setting up the appropriate access based on your needs.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- A TradDocs [account](https://www.traddocs.com)
- An API key

## Authentication

All requests must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key.

```json cURL
curl https://api.traddocs.com/$TRADDOCS_ENDPOINT \
     -H "x-api-key: $TRADDOCS_API_KEY" \
